# GDP-Analytics
This repository focuses on analyzing GDP data and its implications using Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn.

Introduction

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the relationship between GDP, GDP per capita, and life expectancy across different countries and years. The code performs data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Files

GDP_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
gdp.csv: Sample dataset containing GDP data.
Life-Expectancy-Data.csv: Sample dataset containing life expectancy data.
extracted_data.csv: Output file containing cleaned and merged data.
Instructions

Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Dataset: Place the datasets gdp.csv and Life-Expectancy-Data.csv in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
Execution: Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) and execute the code cells sequentially.
Analysis: Read the analysis comments within the notebook to understand the insights gained from the data.
Results: Visualizations and analysis results will be displayed within the notebook.
Analysis Overview

Data Cleaning:
Integration of GDP and life expectancy datasets.
Removal of redundant columns.
Standardization of column names.
Selection of relevant features.
Preservation of cleaned data in a new CSV file.
Data Visualization:
Scatter plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita across different years.
Bar chart displaying countries with life expectancy one standard deviation above the mean.
Scatter plots illustrating countries with low GDP and high life expectancy, and low GDP per capita and high life expectancy.
Insights:
Analysis of the relationship between GDP, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.
Explanation of factors influencing life expectancy disparities within and across economies.
Discussion:
Consideration of variations in life expectancy within major economies.
Comparison of scenarios based on total GDP and GDP per capita as markers of large economies.
Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between economic indicators and life expectancy, highlighting the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors in shaping public health outcomes. The code and results can be used for further research and policy-making aimed at improving health equity and socioeconomic development globally.
